# Dice Simulations
Simulations of dice rolls because I can't just sit back and enjoy the game like a normal person. This repo contains two distinct dice simulators.

## Bang Dice
Simulations of the bang dice game aimed at assessing the likelihood (and therefore value) of rolling for gattling guns. This tool was developed under a pseudo-BDD process and was designed to provide room for extension later when I inevitably decide that the most important information is _actually_ the expected number of arrows rolled on the way to 3 gattling guns.

## Wild Talents

Simulations for the Wild Talents RPG system aimed at producing probability tables of achieving successes of different widths and quantities (height is pretty noddy).

These simulations were written in Matlab and represent a tremendous amount of personal shame for the choice of language, the ham-fisted attempts to brute force millions of dice rolls, and the arrogance of calling my final recursive-probability-tree-based method `elegance.m`. Please do not look in this folder.
